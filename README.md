# Sound-Physics
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

Changes compared to sonicether/Sound-Physics:
  - Updated to 1.12.2
  - Cleaned up whole codebase (compiled binary shrank by a factor of ~4 in file size)
  
I am currently not working on this anymore, see https://github.com/djpadbit/Sound-Physics for a fork of this fork that brings some new features!
